# Open-AIHENP-Community
From Raw Data to Discovery â€“ Alchemists Handbook
The High Energy Physics (HEP) community has been developing dedicated solutions for processing experiment data over decades. However, with recent advancements in Big Data Analytic, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Cloud (CPU $\&$ GPU) Services, a question of application of such technologies in the domain of HEP data analysis, becomes relevant. As the second part of the trilogy of our alchemy manual, we present our experience with neural-based algorithms training that combines the image-based detector simulation, real-time decision making, particle reconstruction/identification/calibration, theoretical calculation based on the off-the-shelf frameworks, services, and tools. The end-to-end exploratory data analyses (EDA) present in this technote is based on the \href{www.kaggle.com/datasets?utm_medium=paid&utm_source=google.com+search&utm_campaign=datasets&gclid=Cj0KCQjwrfvsBRD7ARIsAKuDvMMejeI3iTGSFPZrN38-rbatA9YPM3aJ_man3Ul7zYRNsgxb05SqclcaAn0EEALw_wcB}{\underline{\textit{Kaggle Image Datasets}}}, but it can be decoupled entirely from the employed datasets, or in other words, it can be coupled/employed with any other HEP experiments. We also provide an interactive web-based interface based on Jupiter Notebooks as the main entry point for the potential user.
